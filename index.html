    <h1>Adventures in Paris</h1>

        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <h3>Wego Walking Tours</h3>
        <p>We started our first full day with a cafe au lait and a croissant at a typical Paris cafe.
        We then made our way to Notre Dame, which was the starting point for our walking tour. The sun
        was shining and the 70-degree weather felt downright balmy compared to the frigid Boston air.</p>
        <p>Some of the highlights from out walking tour:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pont des Arts</li>
                <li>Musee du Louvre</li>
                <li>Arc de Trioumph</li>
                <li>Napoleon's Tomb</li>
                <li>Eiffel Tower</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Speaking of the Eiffel Tower...</h3>
        <p>We timed our tour perfectly for a stroll down the Champs du Mars toward the iconic Paris landmark.
        Once there, we rode in a tiny elevator many, many stories up to the summit. To get to the very top required
        an additional flight of stairs. But the champagne was worth it</p>
        <h3>Dinner Cruise</h3>
        <p>We felt we'd earned a nice dinner with a leisurely cruise along the Seine. It turned out that we were at
        the front of the boat with the best views of the city. And luckily, because Daylight Savings had not yet occurred
        in Paris, we got the best of both - the sunlight and the night views. Breathtaking. And the food was awesome too!</p>
